## Resubmission

* I put the URL subject to a previous NOTE into code markup so it will not be followed.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.2
* win-builder, R 3.2.2

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There were 2 NOTEs:

* Days since last update: 1

  A critical run-time error was found and patched. Sorry.

* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
  Namespace in Imports field not imported from: 'R6'

  R6 is a build-time dependency.
